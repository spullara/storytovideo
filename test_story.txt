Once upon a time, a small robot named Bolt found a glowing seed in a junkyard. The seed pulsed with mysterious energy, and Bolt knew it was special. He carefully picked it up and decided to plant it in the only patch of soil he could find. Days passed, and the seed grew into a magnificent tree with golden leaves. The tree's light spread across the entire junkyard, transforming it into a beautiful garden. Other robots came to see the miracle, and Bolt became known as the gardener who brought life to the wasteland.
