On the morning of her 80th birthday, Miriam discovered she could hear colors. The red curtains in her bedroom hummed a low cello note. The blue sky outside her window sang like a choir of flutes. She shuffled to the kitchen, where the yellow walls played a warm jazz piano. Her granddaughter Lily arrived with a bouquet of wildflowers, and the room erupted into a symphony. "Grandma, why are you crying?" Lily asked. Miriam held the flowers close. "Because I've been a painter my whole life," she whispered, "and I never knew what my paintings sounded like." Together they walked to Miriam's studio, where decades of canvases lined the walls. Each painting sang its own melody. Lily recorded them on her phone while Miriam conducted with a paintbrush, finally hearing the music she had unknowingly composed across a lifetime of art.
